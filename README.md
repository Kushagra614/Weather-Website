# Weather App

This is a simple Weather Application that fetches and displays real-time weather information for any location using the WeatherAPI. It shows the temperature, location name, date, time, weather condition, and an icon representing the current weather condition.

## Features

- **Live Weather Updates**: Displays the current weather data including temperature, location, time, and weather conditions.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for weather in any city or location worldwide.
- **Weather Condition Icon**: Dynamically updates the weather condition image based on real-time data.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: To fetch and display real-time weather data.
- **WeatherAPI**: Provides the weather data based on the location query.

## How It Works

1. When the page loads, the default weather information for Delhi is fetched and displayed.
2. Users can enter a location in the search field to get the current weather for that specific area.
3. The application makes an asynchronous request to the WeatherAPI using JavaScript's `fetch()` method.
4. Upon receiving the data, the app dynamically updates the DOM to display the temperature, location name, time, date, weather condition, and an icon for the condition.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd weather-app
   ```

3. Add your WeatherAPI Key:
   - Sign up on WeatherAPI to get your free API key.
   - Open the JavaScript file and replace `API_KEY` with your own API key:

     ```javascript
     let url = `http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=${API_KEY}&q=${target}&aqi=no`;
     ```

   Note: The app will not work without your own valid API key.

4. Open `index.html` in a web browser:
   Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser to see the app in action.

## Code Overview

### HTML

The layout contains a search bar, weather information section, and fields to display the location, temperature, condition, and date.

### CSS

The `temp`, `time_location`, `conditions`, and other sections are styled for a simple and clean look.

### JavaScript

- **Fetch Data**: The `fetchResults()` function fetches the weather data from WeatherAPI.
- **Update DOM**: The `updateData()` function updates the UI with the fetched data.
- **Search Feature**: The `searchforLocation()` function handles the form submission and updates the weather data based on the user's input.

#### Functions Breakdown

- `fetchResults()`: Fetches weather data using the WeatherAPI for the target location.
- `updateData()`: Updates the weather information on the webpage (temperature, location, time, condition, etc.).
- `searchforLocation()`: Handles the search form submission and triggers the data fetch based on user input.
- `getDayName()`: Helper function to convert the date into a human-readable day name (e.g., "Sunday").
